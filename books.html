    <h3 class="h3">Marriage</h3>
    <p class="trevor">Patricia Nombuyiselo is Trevor Noah's mother who played a big role in the author's life.<br>
        Marriage is an agreement between two individuals to stay together as husband and wife. It entails traditional
        ceremonies and other people may opt out of the traditional bit. Communities have their  theories
        when it comes to marriage, for example in some communities, women kneel to greet elders and  husbands
        and also to show respect like the Iteso of Uganda while in other communities like the banyankole of Uganda,
        greet by hugging. I strongly disagree with the norm among the Tzaneen people where women have to bow to
        there husbands, i believe that respect is earned and not commanded. This theory of women doing all the work isn’t
        fair also because the males grow up to be lazy people if they don’t even lay their beds as said by Trevor. I believe in a community
        where people work together and both males and females are treated equally. Because of this book, I have realized
        that  male chauvinism began a long time in the olden days but  there wasnt a better term for it. <br><br>
        Patricia was a happy independent woman not until she got married.
        She didn’t have anyone demanding her respect she thought that therefore
        it would remain as is even when she got married to Abel.
        Abel was the first male in the home therefore he grew up being 
        accorded all the respect there was so when he got 
        married to Patricia , he expected the same degree of respect. To Abel,
        this was frustrating because it made him feel less of a man and 
        generally men hate to feel like they are being 
        overridden because, by nature, they are the heads of the home. 
        This is portrayed when Patricia leaves her job to focus on
        managing the workshop full-time. She started keeping the books, 
        making the schedule, and balancing the accounts 
        because of how Abel was spending the little profits they got. 
        The workshop was doing well and when everyone 
        was appreciating Patricia's efforts, Abel felt like she was running his business.
        If only Abel had let Patricia manage that workshop, they would have thrived but 
        his ego led to his failure. When Abel stopped taking bang, he resorted to taking
        a lot of Alcohol which made him wilder to the extent of shooting Patricia. 
        If only he had stopped taking alcohol, he would have been a better husband

<h3 class="h3" > Humour</h3>
    <p class="trevor" > Humor is one of the major techies Trevor used in this book. 
        The biggest impact of humor in Born a Crime is that it created a sense of 
        curiosity in me that enabled me to read on. For example, 
        telling us how he ran with his mother through the whole neighborhood, 
        Trevor called it a tom and jerry relationship. Because of humor, Trevor 
        was able to make even the most difficult parts of the book lighter.
        When Noah was talking about the number of times they went to church 
        in a week, Saturday was his day off, and he called it time to sin. 
        It shows how resilient he was by accepting to attend all those church programs.
        <br><br>
        When Trevor’s grandfather made a joke once and a white policeman was amused by it, 
        it was a shock to see a white policeman laughing with a black person. This helped to 
        illustrate the extent of apartheid, furthermore the extent of separation between 
        the black and white people.At the point when Patricia was shot she was in a critical
        condition and Trevor thought they had lost her. The next day when she 
        consciousness Trevor was crying and Patricia to him to stop crying and to look
        on the bright side, what bright side? The bright side was that Trevor had the
        best-looking nose because Patricia’s nose had been ruined. With this joke,
        they were able to have a moment of joy amidst the tragedy. It also encourages 
        us not to focus on the negative effects of a problem but to at least look for the positive side
